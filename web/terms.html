<p>After the 7 days your deposit will become non-refundable and if you decide to cancel you have also incur reasonable fees for any services we have provided already, if these are of a more value than the original deposit. </p>

<p>Deposits cannot normally be made in cash. PayPal is the preferred method of payment. </p>

<p>Bookings made with less than 7 days until the scheduled event will require full payment upfront unless paying cash on the night at the start of the event. </p>

<p><b>2. Payments </b></p>

<p>The remaining balance may usually be paid up to 7 days before the scheduled date via PayPal. Cash on the night is a preferred payment, however this may not be available in some situations. </p>

<p>For all cash on the night payments, performance or setup may not be completed unless payment is made before the event start time. </p>

<p>If you require other payment arrangements, please let Shaun Brady DJ Services know well in advance of the proposed performance. </p>

Shaun Brady DJ Services does not offer refunds or reductions if you discover an additional extra (which has been included during booking) is no longer required. </p>

<p><i>3.1 Smoke machines</i></p>

<p>Before booking any atmospheric effect (smoke machine) it is advised you ask your venue if they are happy for them to be used. ~It is likely your venue may be fitted with smoke detectors and the machines may set off an alarm in the venue. </p>

<p><i>3.2 Bubble and snow machines </i></p>

<p>Before booking please ensure your venue permits the use of these machines. If being used on hard surfaces such as a dance floor, tiled floor or any uncarpeted space these machines may cause the floor to become slippery. It is advised that all guests are warned of the risk of a slip hazard before entering the area of which the bubble machine is active. </p>

<p><i>3.3 Lighting </i></p>

<p>We cannot guarantee your lighting will reach some areas you may require due to lack of plug sockets, distance from plug socket or difficulty installing lights. Chosen colours often may appear different depending on background and light limitations. </p>

<p><i>3.4 Glow Sticks </i></p>

<p>Not suitable for children under 3 years old. Whilst glow sticks are non-toxic they should only be bent to activate and contents should not be ingested. If incorrectly used the contents may cause staining to furniture or clothing. </p>
